#### URL Structure

First, let's take a look at what a typical URL request for the API would look like:

	http://geoip.shopgo.io/api/lookup?ip=188.200.60.110&format=json

This can be split into three parts:

1. **The stem** — `http://geoip.shopgo.io/api/lookup`, which is the path to access the API. `https` is also supported.

1. **Required parameters** — `ip` to set IP you are looking for.

1.  **Additional parameters** — `format`, to specify XML or JSON

#### Parameters

Additional parameters take the form of a query string attached to the end of the URL path.

> **Reminder:** A query string is indicated by a `?` and lists key-value pairs in the form `key=value`, separated by an `&`. The order of these pairs does not make a difference.

#### Results

Regardless of the format you choose for the results, the structure is simple and clean. Take a look for yourself!

* JSON

       {
        "countryCode":"NL",
        "en":"Netherlands",
        "ar":"هولندا"
       }

* XML

		<result>
            <countryCode>NL</countryCode>
            <en>Netherlands</en>
            <ar>هولندا</ar>
        </result>


#### What now?
Now that you know how to access the API, you can use the results to populate a dropdown list or an autocomplete text field, or use them in any other creative way you can think of!
